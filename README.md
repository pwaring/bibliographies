# Bibliographies

This repository contains a number of bibliographies in BibTeX format, for use in articles and books. It is mainly for my personal use, but may serve as reading lists for particular topics.

[JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) is the recommended tool for browsing the bibliographies. It is written in Java and available for Linux, Windows and OS X.
