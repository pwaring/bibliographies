	on a previously unseen (new) event are marked. The method is based
	on an incremental TF-IDF model. Our extensions include: generation
	of source-specific models, similarity score normalization based on
	document-specific averages, similarity score normalization based
	on source-pair specific averages, term reweighting based on inverse
	event frequencies, and segmentation of the documents. We also report
	on extensions that did not improve results. The system performs very
	well on TDT3 and TDT4 test data and scored second in the TDT-2002

	434 million automatically disambiguated semantic tags, published
	to the web as a label bureau providing metadata regarding the 434

	discuss the architecture of the SemTag application, describe a new
	disambiguation algorithm specialized to support ontological disambiguation
	of large-scale data, evaluate the algorithm, and present our final
	results with information about acquiring and making use of the semantic

	predicts sales ranks. Second, these queries can be automatically

	might be difficult to predict in general, algorithmic predictors
	can use online postings to successfully predict spikes in sales rank.},

	labelled as 'YASNS' (Yet Another Social Networking Service) - this
	seems like a sweeping statement by the author with, incidentally,
	no citation to back it up.
	
	
	The point about web interfaces to social networks only showing a linear
	list of friends rather than a proper network (probably best represented
	as a graph with nodes for individuals and vertices representing connections
	such as colleagues or friends) is a valid one, though I am not sure
	that I entirely agree with the assertation of the authors that this
	makes it problematic for members to explore their online community.
	Gauging both the scale and the individuals to which personal data
	is exposed is, for example, only an issue if privacy is set to 'friends
	of friends' rather than 'friends only' or 'anyone'.
	
	
	Major problem I notice with creating such a graph is that it will
	not include anyone who has set their profile to 'friends only' (if
	this is possible on Friendster, the social networking site which
	is being examined in this paper), unless the tool which the authors
	are using to create this network representation is using a user account
	which has been befriended by the 1.5 million users crawled - I suspect
	this is unlikely.
	
	
	Where is the evidence for 'the vast majority of users throughout 2003
	were in their 20s'?
	
	
	Spends a bit too much time describing the software and saying how
	great it is - this is not good! Significant sections are handed over
	to discussing how the software displays results, but very little
	evaluation or explanation of why this is useful.},

  abstract = {Communication researchers and social scientists are quickly discovering
	the value of data that exists in the postings of members of Internet
	e-mail, Usenet, and real-time groups. The ability to communicate
	with one's peers, no matter how esoteric the interests, is causing
	an explosion in the number of new virtual communities. The interpersonal
	dynamics of these groups are increasingly coming under the scrutiny
	of academic research. The publicly available archived records of
	Internet virtual communities are being analyzed for a wide variety
	of research interests. The ability to do naturalistic observations
	of group dynamics, as they are exhibited in these exchanges of text,
	has captured the attention of many researchers. The institutional
	review boards of major universities are granting researchers exempt
	or expedited (exempt from full review) status for this work, due
	to the public nature of the notes being analyzed. These studies often
	involve the lack of informed consent, where the group members under
	study are unaware they are being monitored. There is a potential
	for psychological harm to the members of these groups, depending
	on the way results are reported. This article explores the ethical
	considerations that must be taken into account to protect cyberspace
	participants. The guidelines proposed are based on the American Psychological
	Association ethical guidelines for use of human subjects in research.
	An explanation is offered as to how such guidelines can best be applied
	to the study of Internet communities. The constructs of Group Accessibility
	(the public/private nature of the actual cyberspace occupied by a
	group) and Perceived Privacy (the level of privacy that group members
	assume they have) are defined and proposed as two dimensions by which
	individual Internet communities may be evaluated in order to assure
	the ethical reporting of research findings.},

  abstract = {Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a research initiative that aims
	at techniques to organize news documents in terms of news events.
	We propose a method that incorporates simple semantics into TDT by
	splitting the term space into groups of terms that have the meaning
	of the same type. Such a group can be associated with an external
	ontology. This ontology is used to determine the similarity of two
	terms in the given group. We extract proper names, locations, temporal
	expressions and normal terms into distinct sub-vectors of the document
	representation. Measuring the similarity of two documents is conducted
	by comparing a pair of their corresponding sub-vectors at a time.
	We use a simple perceptron to optimize the relative emphasis of each
	semantic class in the tracking and detection decisions. The results
	suggest that the spatial and the temporal similarity measures need
	to be improved. Especially the vagueness of spatial and temporal
	terms needs to be addressed.},

	clusters) of similar contexts of the ambiguous word. Words, contexts,
	and senses are represented in Word Space, a high-dimensional, real-valued
	space in which closeness corresponds to semantic similarity. Similarity
	in Word Space is based on second-order co-occurrence: two tokens
	(or contexts) of the ambiguous word are assigned to the same sense
	cluster if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar
	words in a training corpus. The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised
	in both training and application: senses are induced from a corpus
	without labeled training instances or other external knowledge sources.
	The paper demonstrates good performance of context-group discrimination
	for a sample of natural and artificial ambiguous words.},

	- What events will different users find relevant when browsing X thousand

	- What events are significant in some sense, at global, national and
	local scales?
	
	
	Topic Detection and Tracking - aimed at developing techniques for
	'discovering and threading together topically related material from
	streams of data such as newswire and broadcast news'.
	
	
	Topics defined as 'something (non-trivial) happening in a certain
	place at a certain time'.
	
	TDT posseses an 'explicitly time-tagged corpus' due to its focus on
	news data.
	
	
	Most significant problem in using TDT on historical texts is the difficulty
	of handling long-running topics - e.g. mentions to current inquiry
	into the death of Princes Diana will not necessarily be directly
	linked to previous investigations or the crash itself.This is particularly
	prevalent in historical texts - e.g. the Peloponnesian War would
	probably not be classed as a single event (but then the question
	of whether it should be treated as a single event or not arises).
	
	
	Modern texts vs. historical texts
	
	News stories are headed by datelines, so it is relatively easy to
	associate each term with that date. However, most historical texts
	do not fit this model for several reasons:
	
	1. Discursiveness: Historical texts (with the exceptions of chronicles
	and diaries) are not broken into discrete date units, and trying
	to impose such a structure on these events can be difficult. Associating
	data in a text with the text around it is not always the right thing
	to do.
	
	2. Digression: News stories tend not to digress, unlike historians
	who may often refer to events before or after the main period, or
	parallel events occuring in another region.
	
	3. Scale: Many historical works and longer than news stories, not
	only in the actual size of the text but also in the time period covered.
	Most news stories refer to current (say maximum of one week old)
	events, possibly with the occasional reference to previous events
	related to the main story (e.g. original arrest of someone recently
	convicted of a crime), whereas historical texts may cover periods
	spanning several years or even entire centuries.
	
	
	Additional problems include:
	
	i) Older documents (or those composed by scholars in different cultures)
	may use dating schemes other than the modern, Western Gregorian calendar.
	
	a) Simultaneous events may have different dates on different calendars.
	
	b) Ancient documents often dated years based on magistrates rather
	than numbers - e.g. Athens had 'in the archonship of...', which is
	made even more difficult by the fact that the Athenian calendar ran
	from summer to summer, so when translated we end up with dates such
	as 451/0 BC.
	
	c) Different ways of stating the date, even in the same system - e.g.
	BC, BCE, AD etc. Any system which is not based on Christian dating
	schemes (which is what BC and AD represent) may be confusing to the
	majority of scholars.
	
	
	One way to avoid this problem is to acquire texts which have already
	been annotated with their modern date equivalents, but these are
	not always available and they obviously still involve a degree of
	manual intervention and of course there is no guarantee that these
	annotations are validate.
	
	
	So in summary, requirements are:
	
	1. Identify dates.
	
	2 Disambiguate and normalise if necessary.},

	personalized evaluations when developing websites for specific audiences.},
  owner = {waringp3},
  review = {The authors start off by making the (possibly obvious) point that
	meeting Wed Accessibility Guidelines does not automatically make
	a website accessible to users with disabilities, with reference to
	two other works and the relevant standards, and also that failing
	to follow these standards do not make sites inaccessible for all
	user groups (e.g. only users with some form of sight disability require
	alternative descriptions of images - such information, if omitted,
	would not make a site inaccessible to deaf users). In other words,
	accessibility guidelines are basically a description of techniques
	which should be used in order to ensure that sites are more likely
	to be accessible, however they do not cater to the needs of individual
	users.
	
	
	Point about grouping guidelines based on their impact on particular
	groups of users seems sensible, along with the criticisms of why
	this is not always appropriate/useful. In particular the following
	criticisms were useful:
	
	
	1. Users within a group vary in terms of their needs - for example
	partially sighted viewers may only require descriptions of small
	or complex images, whereas blind users will require descriptions
	of all relevant images (with the exception of those which are purely
	decorative).
	
	
	2. Multiple group membership: most evaluation tools do not support
	this feature, even though many users may be members of more than
	one group.
	
	
	Interesting suggestion of recommendation to sort and/or rank search
	results according to accessibility or usability, or even broaden
	this to include all disabilities. Not sure how easy it would be to
	implement this as presumably pages would need to be checked for accessibility
	in some automated fashion (potentially difficult), this ranking would
	really have to be done on the client side (slow) unless search engines
	could be encouraged to do the sorting (complicated, not necessarily
	beneficial and by definition only applicable to a small percentage
	of customers)
	
	
	p.97 paragraph 2 has too many buzzwords and italics
	
	
	I'm not entirely convinced that ranking/sorting links by accessibility
	is a good idea - just because a page is accessible it doesn't mean
	it contains the information a user is looking for (perhaps use this
	as a final or low-weighted ranking factor?)
	
	
	N.B. Some of the technologies mentioned are not simply for disabled
	users - for example speech recognition software is generally useful
	(dictation) and some people prefer a trackball device to a mouse.
	
	
	Contributions: Extension of UGL to refer to AT features and access
	device constraints.
	
	
	Criticisms:
	
	
	Too much description of words used to describe device dependancies
	in MWBP 1.0, could have just given one or two examples instead of
	listing everything and using up half a page.
	
	
	Abbreviations used often - I kept forgetting what AT and CC/PP etc.
	meant. Also not used consistently - sometimes assitive technologies
	is used, something AT.
	
	
	'Obtained results actually constitute an upper bound for the degree
	of accessibility since evaluation reports are based on automatic
	evaluation and must still be verified through manual evaluation'
	(p.102-3) - doesn't this severely limit the usefulness of the report
	to only narrowing down the number of sites to be manually evaluated?
	Surely the goal is to remove manual evaluation?
	
	
	The method of calculating ranks must be done on each page and for
	all the links on that page (hopefully there is a cache to prevent
	pages being re-evaluated each time). Also, the authors suggest that
	a solution to pages with lots of links would be to pre-fetch by more
	than just one level - this is potentially very dangerous as it could
	mean thousands of links - if the problem is too many links, pre-fetching
	will only exacerbate this!
	
	
	'There should be an agreement between web developers and AT manufacturers
	to create a vocabulary or ontology for the description of ATs' (p.103)
	- yes, and there should be cross-platform/browser support for CSS3
	implemented in all web browsers - wouldn't life be lovely if this
	was the case?
	
	
	'This problem is faced quite often since people with disabilities
	tend to be reluctant to change or upgrade their assistive technologies'
	(p.96) - refers to a book but where in the book does it say this?},

  abstract = {Environmental scanning, the acquisition and use of the information
	about events, trends, and relationships in an organization's external
	environment, permits an organization to adapt to its environment
	and to develop effective responses to secure or improve the organization's
	position in the future. Event detection technique that identifies
	the onset of new events from streams of news stories would facilitate
	the process of organization's environmental scanning. However, traditional
	event detection techniques generally adopted the feature co-occurrence
	approach that identifies whether a news story contains an unseen
	event by comparing the similarity of features between the new story
	and past news stories. Such feature-based event detection techniques
	greatly suffer from the word mismatch and inconsistent orientation
	problems and do not directly support event categorization and news
	stories filtering. In this study, we developed an information extraction-based
	event detection (NEED) technique that combines information extraction
	and text categorization techniques to address the problems inherent
	to traditional feature-based event detection techniques. Using a
	traditional feature-based event detection technique (i.e., INCR)
	as benchmarks, the empirical evaluation results showed that the proposed
	NEED technique improved the effectiveness of event detection measured
	by the tradeoff between miss and false alarm rates.},

	documents are unlabelled, and most of the events have a short duration
	in time. We adapted several supervised text categorization methods,
	specifically several new variants of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
	algorithm and a Rocchio approach, to track events. All of these methods
	showed significant improvement (up to 71% reduction in weighted error
	rates) over the performance of the original kNN algorithm on TDT
	benchmark collections, making kNN among the top-performing systems
	in the recent TDT3 official evaluation. Furthermore, by combining
	these methods, we significantly reduced the variance in performance
	of our event tracking system over different data collections, suggesting
	a robust solution for parameter optimization.},
